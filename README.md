# Chaldea-Dataset

This is a repository to publish dataset of [Chaldea](https://github.com/chaldea-center/chaldea) app.

If you want to install Chaldea app and your platform is:
- Android & Windows x64: download latest build at [Chaldea-Release](https://github.com/chaldea-center/chaldea/releases) page
- iOS & macOS: search "Chaldea" in App Store

## Download
Go to [Release](https://github.com/chaldea-center/chaldea-dataset/releases) page to download assets.

Here, we provide two kinds of assets:
- **dataset.zip**: contains text and image resources.
- **dataset-text.zip**: contain text resources only.

Warning: images/icons update infrequently and the file size will be extremely larger if images included, 
so we sometimes **only** provide the **text-only** version.
You can import the latest full-size dataset then the latest text-only dataset if neccessary.

## Import
Open Chaldea app, in `Settings`-`Dataset Management` page, click `Import` under `Gamedata` section and select the downloaded file.
