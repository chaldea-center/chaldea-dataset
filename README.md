# Chaldea-Dataset

This is a repository to publish dataset of [Chaldea](https://github.com/narumishi/chaldea) app.

## Download
Go to [Release](https://github.com/narumishi/chaldea-dataset/releases) page to download assets.

Here, we provide two kinds of assets:
- **dataset-*version*.zip**: contains text and image resources.
- **dataset-*version*-without-image.zip**: contain text resources only.

Because images/icons update infrequently and file size will be extremely larger, we sometimes **only** provide the **text-only** version.

## Import
Open Chaldea app, in `Settings`-`Dataset Management` page, click `Import` under `Gamedata` section and select the downloaded file.
